# Name-your-Price-Hotfix
Small hotfix for the WooCommerce Name Your Price plugin - kick off the thousand separator bug


This tiny add-on solves the problem for the Name Your Price extension if the value entered is greater than 999, 
so it fixes the bug with the handling of thousands. So there's no problem if the minimum amount is below 999 and the value entered is above 999, because the thousands selector will be ignored.
